1. Copy the _[index.html](Lab4-Images/index.html)_ file to your computer, save it as index.html, and make the following substitution:
•	Replace “us-east-1:41ea7eaa-bab9-434a-905f-85b835b97c2a” with the identity pool ID you noted in section 1, step 7 above.

_Next, we will upload that file to S3 according to the following steps:_
